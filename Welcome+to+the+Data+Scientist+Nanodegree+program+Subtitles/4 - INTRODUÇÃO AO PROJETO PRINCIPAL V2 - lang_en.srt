1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,209
In the next few years, software developers will need to know how to

2
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:06,589
incorporate deep learning models into everyday applications.

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,960
Anything with a camera will be using an image classification,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,910
object detection, and face recognition,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,164
and so on, all based on deep learning models.

6
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:18,549
For is user interfaces like Alexa, Cortana,

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,390
and Google Assistant all powered by

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,949
speech recognition models will become more and more common.

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:25,829
So, in this project,

10
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,869
you'll be implementing an image classification application.

11
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,039
This app will train a deep learning model on a data set of images,

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,174
then use the trained model to classify images.

13
00:00:36,174 --> 00:00:38,399
First, you'll develop your code in

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,509
a Jupyter notebook to make sure your training implementation works.

15
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,109
Then, you'll convert the code to

16
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,420
a Python application that runs from the command line. Good luck.
