Hi, I'm Gina.

2
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:02,515
I'm Josh.

3
00:00:02,515 --> 00:00:06,910
We're here to share some tips on how to help you succeed in this Nanodegree program.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,390
So, Josh, you've seen a lot of students go do this program. What's your advice?

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,169
Yeah. So, I think one of the the biggest things is,

6
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,454
to be successful in the program,

7
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:18,894
you have to be a really active learner.

8
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,870
What that means is, not just watching all the videos,

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,945
but also a lot of our most successful students take notes,

10
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:28,120
and they take really good notes,

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,219
so whether that's like screenshots of the videos and then written notes underneath,

12
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:35,810
type out notes or for me,

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,755
I actually like just writing things in a notepad that I carry around with me,

14
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:42,120
and then I can look at later.

15
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,619
Also, just when there's coding,

16
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:46,154
writing the code yourself.

17
00:00:46,155 --> 00:00:50,179
So I think one of the biggest things is you have to write

18
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:54,725
code to learn how to code and sometimes that's just a lot of repetition.

19
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,990
Beyond that, there's a lot of things to do with

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,450
time management and how do you manage your time to be a successful student.

21
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,450
Sure. Managing time is definitely

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,159
a very tricky component that has a big contribution to success.

23
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,530
But what we've seen is that students who are most

24
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,030
successful come to the classroom at least two times a week.

25
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,484
So, just making sure you make that habit

26
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:18,099
of going to the classroom regularly can make a huge difference.

27
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:19,524
There's lots of ways to do that.

28
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:22,460
Yeah. Whether that's through like mobile apps or just like blocking out time on

29
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:26,909
your calendar and just keeping that on your daily routine.

30
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,325
But everything is dependent on your background,

31
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:31,980
what your learning style is,

32
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,034
and which parts of the course might be newer to you or easier for you.

33
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:38,129
So, in the end is getting to know what

34
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,560
your pace is and setting expectations for yourself,

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,140
and being open to adjusting your time estimations

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,290
can really help you succeed in the program.

37
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,470
So, sometimes maybe a particular quiz in a lesson might

38
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:52,289
take you a lot longer than other parts of the lesson and

39
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,170
sometimes this can be really good because it can help reinforce

40
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,090
your understanding and really develop your knowledge in that specific topic,

41
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,270
but sometimes it could take way longer than you want to you,

42
00:02:01,269 --> 00:02:02,644
and it can be frustrating.

43
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:05,439
Do you have any advice on how to deal with these situations?

44
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,545
Yeah. So, I'll call those blockers,

45
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,215
and I think we all get them.

46
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:13,039
I think there's two big ways to sort of like address blockers.

47
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,599
One is to use the community.

48
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,269
So, there are a lot of students who just went

49
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,000
through the content that you might be struggling with,

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,770
and they can oftentimes point you in the right direction.

51
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,185
So, for that, we have Slack,

52
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:28,490
and I would strongly recommend being a part of the Slack community.

53
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,700
There are tons of resources that are posted in there,

54
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,709
and a lot of us are even active in there to help students.

55
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,270
Then the second thing is just being able to Google well.

56
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,060
Googling is a skill in of itself.

57
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,800
I think that whether it's being able to take

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,219
like an error from your code and search it or read through

59
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:52,960
the documentation or whether you're trying to really grasp

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,305
a large project and you're looking through an entire blog posts or co-post,

61
00:02:58,305 --> 00:03:01,569
all of those things can help you better internalize the content

62
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,650
and even solve just small snips that might be happening in your code.

63
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,319
So we hope these tips can help you,

64
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,694
but in the end, learning is really a mindset,

65
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:12,199
and everyone is going to struggle.

66
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,329
You have to go into this knowing that it's going to be

67
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,520
challenging and just making sure your patient with

68
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,370
yourself and determined to make sure

69
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,504
this is the best learning experience for you can really help you succeed.

70
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:23,819
Yeah. So, thank you.

71
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,840
We hope that our tips can help you be successful with your Nanodegree program.
