00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
At Udacity, we believe in a few things.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,929
We believe that learning is a lifelong journey.

3
00:00:05,929 --> 00:00:10,734
So we build programs that help you learn cutting-edge skills for jobs of the future.

4
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:14,739
We believe that you learn best by getting your hands dirty with the real work.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,945
You become stronger by learning from your experiences and your mistakes.

6
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,740
Whether that's through quizzes, projects,

7
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,529
discussions with other students or Udacity staff,

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,820
or researching problems online.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,945
Through this Nanodegree program,

10
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,230
you will learn the skills you need to develop

11
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,869
an intuition for solving problems in the field.

12
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:38,459
We aim to give you the best learning experience by providing the framework,

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,810
tools and support you need to be successful.

14
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,905
If something isn't clear at any point,

15
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:46,704
please reach out in Slack,

16
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:49,754
email, or through the classroom feedback channels.

17
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:53,600
With that said, welcome to the Data Science Nanodegree Program.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,280
You're about to embark on an incredible journey,

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,870
and we're so excited to be joining you.
