### SETUP ###

Jupyter - sounds like docorosourus or golangs tool, but executes python,
supports math and others.
Uses markdown.
Also seems to act as a simple web server for the FS

To start a notebook server, enter jupyter notebook in your terminal or console. This will start the server in the directory you ran the command in. That means any notebook files will be saved in that directory. Typically you'd want to start the server in the directory where your notebooks live. However, you can navigate through your file system to where the notebooks are.

When you run the command (try it yourself!), the server home should open in
your browser. By default, the notebook server runs at http://localhost:8888. If
you aren't familiar with this, localhost means your computer and 8888 is the
port the server is communicating on. As long as the server is still running,
you can always come back to it by going to http://localhost:8888 in your
browser.
